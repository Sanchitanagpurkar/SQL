        "\n",
        "Constraints are rules enforced on data columns in a database table. Their primary purpose is to limit the type of data that can be inserted into a table, thereby ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the data. They help maintain data integrity, which means ensuring that the data in the database is consistent, accurate, and valid.\n",
        "\n",
        "* How Constraints Help Maintain Data Integrity:\n",
        "\n",
        "Constraints prevent invalid or inconsistent data from being entered into the database. By defining specific rules, you can ensure that:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Data is accurate: For example, a CHECK constraint can prevent negative values in a column that should only contain positive numbers.\n",
        "Data is consistent: A UNIQUE constraint prevents duplicate entries in a column that should have unique values.\n",
        "Relationships between tables are maintained: FOREIGN KEY constraints ensure that relationships between tables are valid and that data isn't orphaned.\n",
        "Required data is present: NOT NULL constraints ensure that certain columns always have a value.\n",
        "Examples of Common Types of Constraints:\n",
        "\n",
        "* NOT NULL: Ensures that a column cannot contain NULL values. This is crucial for columns that must always have data, like a user ID or a product name.\n",
        "* UNIQUE: Ensures that all values in a column are different. This is often used for email addresses, usernames, or other identifiers that must be unique.\n",
        "* PRIMARY KEY: A combination of NOT NULL and UNIQUE. It uniquely identifies each row in a table. Each table can only have one primary key.\n",
        "* FOREIGN KEY: Used to link two tables together. It establishes a relationship between a column (or set of columns) in one table and the primary key in another table. This ensures referential integrity.\n",
        "* CHECK: Ensures that all values in a column satisfy a specific condition. For * example, you could use a CHECK constraint to ensure that the age of an employee is always greater than or equal to 18.\n",
        "* DEFAULT: Provides a default value for a column when no value is specified during an INSERT operation.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Why would you apply the NOT NULL constraint to a column? Can a primary key contain NULL values? Justify.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Ans-> Applying the NOT NULL constraint to a column ensures that the column must always contain a value and cannot be left empty. This is done for *several reasons:\n",
        "* Data Integrity:\n",
        "It enforces that crucial data is always present, preventing incomplete or missing information that could lead to inconsistencies or errors in data analysis and reporting.\n",
        "* Application Logic:\n",
        "Many applications rely on the presence of certain data for their functionality. A NOT NULL constraint ensures that the application can always expect a value, simplifying development and reducing the need for extensive null-checking logic.\n",
        "* Clarity and Understanding:\n",
        "It clearly communicates the design intent of the database schema, indicating which columns are essential and must always have a value.\n",
        "Can a primary key contain NULL values? Justify.\n",
        "No, a primary key cannot contain NULL values. This is a fundamental rule of relational database design, known as Entity Integrity.\n",
        "* Justification:\n",
        "* Unique Identification:\n",
        "The core purpose of a primary key is to uniquely identify each row in a table. If a primary key column allowed NULL values, it would be impossible to guarantee uniqueness because NULL values are not comparable to each other (i.e., NULL is not equal to NULL). This means two rows could potentially have NULL in their primary key column, violating the uniqueness requirement.\n",
        "Referential Integrity:\n",
        "Primary keys are often used as foreign keys in other tables to establish relationships. If a primary key could be NULL, it would be challenging to maintain referential integrity, as a foreign key could not reliably reference a NULL primary key value.\n",
        "* Data Consistency:\n",

        "  Ans-> Adding and removing constraints on an existing table in SQL is accomplished using the ALTER TABLE statement.\n",
        "* Adding a Constraint:\n",
        "Identify the table and the constraint type: Determine which table requires a new constraint and the specific type of constraint (e.g., PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, CHECK, NOT NULL).\n",
        "Define the constraint: Specify the column(s) involved and any conditions or references required for the constraint.\n",

        "* Removing a Constraint:\n",
        "Identify the table and the constraint name: You must know the name of the constraint you wish to remove.

        "\n",
        "  Ans-> Attempting to insert, update, or delete data in a way that violates database constraints results in the rejection of the operation and the preservation of data integrity. When a constraint violation is detected by the Database Management System (DBMS), the attempted operation is aborted, and any changes made within that transaction are rolled back, restoring the database to its state before the invalid operation. This mechanism prevents the database from entering an inconsistent or corrupted state. An error message is typically generated to inform the user or application about the specific constraint violation.\n",
        "* For example, consider a table named Employees with a UNIQUE constraint on the Email column, ensuring no two employees can have the same email address.\n",
        "If an attempt is made to update an employee's email to a value that already exists for another employee, a unique constraint violation error would occur.\n",
        "An example of such an error message in SQL might be:\n",
        "Code\n",
        "\n",
        "* ORA-00001: unique constraint (SCHEMA_NAME.CONSTRAINT_NAME) violated\n",
